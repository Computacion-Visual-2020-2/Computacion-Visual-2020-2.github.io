# LIGHT SHADERS
## SUGGESTED WORKSHOP

> Simple lighting and material

### Tasks

1. Add ambient light
2. Add light attenuation
3. Add fog
4. Combine all the simple lighting models (ambient, diffuse and specular) using per-vertex and per-pixel shaders
5. Use up to 8 lights in the model, relating each light source with a nub node
Implement advanced lighting models such as Warn lights, normal mapping and shadow mapping.
